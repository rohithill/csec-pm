### Common Error Responses:

Judgement Verdict | Description
----------------- | ----
Memory limit exceeded | 	The program tries to consume more memory than is indicated in the problem statement
Time limit exceeded |	The program hadn't terminated in time indicated in the problem statement
Runtime error |	The program terminated with a non-zero return code (possible reasons: array out of bound error, division by zero, stack overflow, incorrect pointers usage, etc)  <br> Eg. SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault), NZEC (Non Zero Exit Code) (in Python)
Wrong answer |	Wrong answer
Compilation error | Syntax Error or you submitted in the wrong language.

### Some Tips:
- cin/cout in c++ are slow by default which may result in TLE. (Don't mix cin/cout and scanf/printf after this!)
```c++
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL); 
```
- Rather than including libraries one by one, you can include all by using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` in c++ (gcc required)
- Use inbuilt functions. For c++ use STL and for python see the standard library (*itertools, collections*)
